# TechWay

ðŸ’¡ Project Idea

Tech Way is a personal initiative launched by two aspiring developers, Malak and Reem, as part of their journey in learning Full Stack Web Development.

The project aims to assist beginners in discovering the tech field that best aligns with their personality and interests. After answering a set of carefully designed questions, users receive a recommended path in tech, along with suggested courses tailored to that path, to help them get started.

At the same time, Tech Way serves as a hands-on opportunity for us to apply what weâ€™ve learned.
This initial phase focuses on Front-End Development, with future plans to expand into Back-End functionality, data analysis, and more advanced features.
